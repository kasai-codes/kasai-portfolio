List of projects 
## Outline

This single-page website demonstrates my current abilities to build a site with the usage of flex box, css, and html. Potential employers can navigate through projects and determine if my skill-set matches the requirements for their role.

## The goal

My main objective with this website was to learn how to structure an HTML page into rows and columns using flex box values in CSS. Media Queries were also used so that the page still functioned properly with various device screen sizes.
